    <p>
      Losing a loved one is never easy, and during such moments, moving the body safely and respectfully is very important. 
      Our ambulance service is specially designed for <strong>dead body transportation</strong>, ensuring dignity, care, and proper handling at all times.
    </p>

    <p>
      At Allied Medical Services Ltd, we understand how sensitive this process is. That is why our ambulances are equipped 
      specifically for mortuary transfers — not regular hospital movement — and are handled by trained professionals who know what they are doing.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Our Dead Body Ambulance Service Matters</h2>

      Whether the body is being moved from a hospital to a mortuary, from a mortuary to a burial location, or across states, 
      our ambulance service ensures everything is done the right way.
