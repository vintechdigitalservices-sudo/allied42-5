    <h1>Caskets Supply</h1>

    <p>
      A coffin (sometimes called a casket) is the enclosure used to lay a loved one to rest during burial.
      It plays an important role in the final farewell, as it holds the body with care and presents the deceased
      in a dignified and respectful manner.
    </p>

    <p>
      At <strong>Allied Medical Services Ltd</strong>, we help families choose caskets that are
      appropriate, well-prepared, and handled with respect. We understand that these decisions are often made
      during emotional moments, so we guide families calmly and clearly, without pressure.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our focus is to ensure every family can give their loved one a proper send-off with options that balance
      dignity, quality, and practicality.
    </p>
